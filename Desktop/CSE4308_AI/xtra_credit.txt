for the extra credit, static evaluation is funct is called to get the value of current if the depth limit 
                      is reached prior to the code/game ending.

Tne funct uses the score value, in normal version of game it is better to have a lower score so value of score 
                                is set to negative which would push for less marbles. (motive is to lose w low amount of points)
                                
                                in miserie version of game it is opposite, better to finish with more points. 
                                so it is better to make actions that leave more marbles on the table.
